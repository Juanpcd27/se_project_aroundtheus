My project is named Around The U.S

It is the first responsive website I've worked on, it can be opened in a variety of screen displays, mobile included.

I used html and css as I've done before in my other projects, but this time I used FIGMA for the first time, I also applied the knowledge from grid on sprint 3 and media queries.
